1.01:  2005-05-23
	- more POD docs (constructor and method calls)

	- be aware of all forms of IP address (a, a.b, a.b.c, a.b.c.d)
	  where all of a, b, c, and d can be in decimal, octal, or hex.
	  (thanks to Martin Atkins and Timwi for pointing this out) pass
	  in the canonicalized version of the IP address to the bad hosts
	  checker.

1.00:  2005-05-20
 	- fix holes pointed out by Martin Atkins (led to me doing all the
	  Net::DNS and manual resolving work)

	- bundle the test script by adding a local webserver mode to it,
	  rather than using an xinetd script
